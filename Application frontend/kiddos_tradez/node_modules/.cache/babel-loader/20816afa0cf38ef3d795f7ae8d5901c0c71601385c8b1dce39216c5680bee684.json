Hence there is no \"development\" in the US in mobile\r\n          messaging service. The GSM in the US had to use a frequency allocated\r\n          for private communication services (PCS) – what the ITU frequency\r\n          régime had blocked for DECT – Digital Enhanced Cordless\r\n          Telecommunications – 1000-feet range picocell, but survived. American\r\n          Personal Communications (APC), the first GSM carrier in America,\r\n          provided the first text-messaging service in the United States. Sprint\r\n          Telecommunications Venture, a partnership of Sprint Corp. and three\r\n          large cable-TV companies, owned 49 percent of APC. The Sprint venture\r\n          was the largest single buyer at a government-run spectrum auction that\r\n          raised $7.7 billion in 2005 for PCS licenses. APC operated under the\r\n          brand name of Sprint Spectrum and launched its service on 15 November\r\n          1995, in Washington, D.C. and in Baltimore, Maryland. Vice President\r\n          Al Gore in Washington, D.C. made the initial phone-call to launch the\r\n          network, calling Mayor Kurt Schmoke in Baltimore.[14] Initial growth\r\n          of text messaging worldwide was slow, with customers in 1995 sending\r\n          on average only 0.4 messages per GSM customer per month.[15] One\r\n          factor in the slow take-up of SMS was that operators were slow to set\r\n          up charging systems, especially for prepaid subscribers, and to\r\n          eliminate billing fraud, which was possible by changing SMSC settings\r\n          on individual handsets to use the SMSCs of other operators.[citation\r\n          needed] Over time, this issue was eliminated by switch billing instead\r\n          of billing at the SMSC and by new features within SMSCs to allow\r\n          blocking of foreign mobile users sending messages through it.[citation\r\n          needed] SMS is available on a wide range of networks, including 3G\r\n          networks. However, not all text-messaging systems use SMS; some\r\n          notable alternate implementations of the concept include J-Phone's\r\n          SkyMail and NTT Docomo's Short Mail, both in Japan. E-mail messaging\r\n          from phones, as popularized by NTT Docomo's i-mode and the RIM\r\n          BlackBerry, also typically use standard mail protocols such as SMTP\r\n          over TCP/IP.[16] As of 2007 text messaging was the most widely used\r\n          mobile data service, with 74% of all mobile phone users worldwide, or\r\n          2.4 billion out of 3.3 billion phone subscribers, at the end of 2007\r\n          being active users of the Short Message Service. In countries such as\r\n          Finland, Sweden, and Norway, over 85% of the population use SMS. The\r\n          European average is about 80%, and North America is rapidly catching\r\n          up with over 60% active users of SMS by end of 2008.[citation needed]\r\n          The largest average usage of the service by mobile phone subscribers\r\n          occurs in the Philippines, with an average of 27 texts sent per day\r\n          per subscriber.[citation needed]\r\n        </p>\r\n      </Box>\r\n    </Box>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Profile;\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAOC,aAAa,MAAM,8CAA8C;AACxE,OAAOC,UAAU,MAAM,wCAAwC;AAC/D,SAASC,GAAG,QAAQ,aAAa;AACjC,SAASC,IAAI,QAAQ,sBAAsB;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAC5C,MAAMC,OAAO,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EACpB,oBACED,OAAA,CAACH,GAAG;IAACK,EAAE,EAAE;MAAEC,eAAe,EAAE,OAAO;MAAEC,OAAO,EAAE,MAAM;MAAEC,MAAM,EAAE;IAAQ,CAAE;IAAAC,QAAA,gBAEtEN,OAAA,CAACH,GAAG;MAACK,EAAE,EAAE;QAAEK,QAAQ,EAAE,OAAO;QAAEC,GAAG,EAAE,CAAC;QAAEC,MAAM,EAAE;MAAE,CAAE;MAAAH,QAAA,eAChDN,OAAA,CAACL,aAAa;QAAAe,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA;IAAG;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACb,eAGNb,OAAA,CAACH,GAAG;MAACK,EAAE,EAAE;QAAEK,QAAQ,EAAE,OAAO;QAAEC,GAAG,EAAE,CAAC;QAAEM,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC;QAAEL,MAAM,EAAE;MAAE,CAAE;MAAAH,QAAA,eACzDN,OAAA,CAACJ,UAAU;QAAAc,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA;IAAG;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACV,eAGNb,OAAA,CAACH,GAAG;MACFK,EAAE,EAAE;QACFE,OAAO,EAAE,MAAM;QACfW,cAAc,EAAE,KAAK;QACrBC,OAAO,EAAE,MAAM;QACfb,eAAe,EAAE;MACnB,CAAE;MAAAG,QAAA,gBAEFN,OAAA;QAAAM,QAAA,EAAG;MAoFH;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI,eACJb,OAAA;QAAAM,QAAA,EAAG;MAoFH;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAI;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACA;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,QACF;AAEV,CAAC;AAACI,EAAA,GAnMIhB,OAAO;AAqMb,eAAeA,OAAO;AAAC,IAAAgB,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
